    "- Since 2NF requires the relation to first satisfy the conditions of 1NF (i.e., atomic values, uniqueness) and then ensure there are no partial dependencies on the candidate key. If a relation violates 1NF, it cannot be in 2NF, as 2NF builds on 1NF. So, let's assume \"a relation is in 2NF\".\n",
